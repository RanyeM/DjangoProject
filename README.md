# Reference-Architecture
Reference Architectures for various tech stacks

Every folder contains the basic, containerized structure required for a well structured project.  To use, clone the repo and copy the contents of your desired folder into a new project.  Each project will contain the following:
* Docker files to allow running app locally without installing local dependencies
* Commands to add dependencies from within docker container
* Integration and unit tests
* Test commands and containers to run tests in
* a helpful .gitignore file
* helpful extras as needed for each project
